The project shows an example on how you can implement interctive map with Naninovel without any C# scripts.

The map is implemented as a [custom UI](https://naninovel.com/guide/user-interface.html#adding-custom-ui) and stored at `Assets/Prefabs/MapUI`. The locations are regular Unity buttons placed in the UI.

The button's click and hover events are handled with Naninovel's [Play Script](https://naninovel.com/guide/user-interface.html#play-script-on-unity-event) component.

The availability of the locations is controlled with [Variable Trigger](https://naninovel.com/guide/custom-variables.html#variable-triggers) components attached to the buttons.

Be aware, that [Naninovel](https://u3d.as/1pg9) package is not distributed with the project, hence compilation errors will be produced after opening it for the first time; import Naninovel from the Asset Store to resolve the issues.
